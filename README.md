## Notes
* **Important!:** I used an emoji of lightbulb  (ðŸ’¡) to mark my ideas, comments  and so on.
* **Architecture:** MVVM with a modern android architecture using UI->Domain->Data layers.
* **Design patterns**: Dependency injection with Hilt, Observable patterns with Flow and states (StateFlow, SharedFlow).
* **Database:** Simple Room database integrated with flows and **Repository** patterns.
* **Datasources:** Local and Remote, Remote uses Retrofit to perform simple calls to mockeable.io.
* **Domain layer** Used a simple domain layer for extracting tasks as Use Cases, importan for larger projects, I consider it's better to use it early instead of refactoring later.
* **Tests:** Some *unit tests* to verify task behaviour and cover expected results given conditions, some *instrumented tests* such as Compose tests, Database, API and so on.
* **Technology:** An approach of *Jetpack Compose* as a Single page application. Flows, coroutines, Room, Retrofit, Dagger Hilt, WebMockServer, Google Maps, Mockk.
* **ToDo's:** I wanted to create unit tests with Turbine to test view-model's flows and it's integration with state and ui events, but not time to acomplish it.
